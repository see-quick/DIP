\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{02:chapter:title}

This chapter provides the fundamentals of the technologies used across the whole thesis.
Notable technologies used are Kubernetes\footnote{Kubernetes \---\ orchestration system created in 2014 by Google (\url{https://kubernetes.io/})}, Apache Kafka\footnote{Apache Kafka \---\ distributed messaging system originally created in 2013 by LinkedIn (\url{https://kafka.apache.org/})} and Strimzi\footnote{Strimzi \---\ collection of operators for deploying and managing Apache Kafka on top of the Kubernetes (\url{https://strimzi.io/})}, which are described in details in the following sections.
Note that high level descriptions of these technologies were already published in bachelor's thesis~\cite{02-bachelor-thesis} written by the same author as this thesis.
In this chapter the author aims to explain the technology in more technical depth.
Furthermore, some ideas related to Kubernetes were taken from the \emph{The Kubernetes book}~\cite{kubernetesBook}.
Section~\ref{02:sec:strimzisystemtests} describes the \emph{e2e (end-to-end)}  Strimzi tests that run on the top of the Kubernetes cluster.
Also note that author described this topic in series of blogs posts \emph{Introduction to system tests}~\cite{02-blogpost-introduction-to-systemtest} and \emph{How system tests work}~\cite{02-blogpost-how-systemtest-work}.
