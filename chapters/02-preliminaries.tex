\chapter{Preliminaries}

This chapter provides the fundamentals of technologies used across the whole thesis. Notable technologies used are Kubernetes\footnote{Kubernetes \---\ orchestration system found in 2014 by Google (\url{https://kubernetes.io/})}, Apache Kafka\footnote{Apache Kafka \---\ distributed messaging system originally founded in 2013 by LinkedIn (\url{https://kafka.apache.org/})} and Strimzi\footnote{Strimzi \---\ collection of operators for deploying and managing Apache Kafka on top of the Kubernetes (\url{https://strimzi.io/})}, which are described in details in the following sections. Note that descriptions of these technologies were already published in bachelor's thesis \cite{02-bachelor-thesis} written by the same author as this thesis. On the other hand, the author tried to explain the obscure things better and more clearly, and at the same time keep the things that were very well described. Furthermore, some ideas related to the Kubernetes were taken from the \emph{The Kubernetes book} \cite{kubernetesBook}. 
Section \ref{02:sec:strimzisystemtests} describes the \emph{e2e (end to end)}  Strimzi tests that run on the top of the Kubernetes cluster. Also note that author described this topic in series of blogs posts \emph{Introduction to system tests} \cite{02-blogpost-introduction-to-systemtest} and \emph{How system tests work} \cite{02-blogpost-how-systemtest-work} and has taken over a few sections that were necessary.
