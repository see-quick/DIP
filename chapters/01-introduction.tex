\chapter{Introduction}

% 1) paralalicia vseobecne
These days, we are increasingly encountering parallel programs.
A dozen programs that have been written in a typical way for single-core systems cannot take advantage of the presence of computers with multiple cores.
When we wanted to speed up problem-solving, we wanted to create something that would eliminate our time on calculations.
Thus, we invented the computer, which at the beginning knew relatively nothing to do.
However, after a few years, all this changed, and the computer solved problems that took a person many days.
Nowadays, we live in a time when computers have significantly improved execution time by solving different problems using parallelism.

% 2) úvod do problematiky
In recent years, many companies have adopted Kubernetes (\ref{01:sec:title}) and the microservices architecture it enables.
This technology was opened up many new possibilities not just for large companies but also for small software developers.
Kubernetes is a container-orchestration system, and recently a new concept has emerged around how to orchestrate the containers more efficiently \---\ the Operator pattern.
One such operator is developed and maintained under an open-source project called Strimzi (\ref{03:title}).
The Strimzi project gathers together several tools that take care of Apache Kafka's (\ref{02:sec:title}) deployment on Kubernetes.
Since Kafka is a complex, horizontally scalable, distributed system, one can imagine that its installation is a relatively complex action.
Therefore, one of the biggest challenges of using Kubernetes is how to effectively and quickly test projects such as Kafka and Strimzi and at the same time verify integration with other similar products.
The resources needed by Kubernetes are much more demanding than Kafka's deployment on virtual machines or typical container instances.
To tackle this problem, we adopted the principles of parallel execution and created a mechanism within Strimzi system tests (\ref{02:sec:strimzisystemtests}), which runs tests in parallel against only a single Kubernetes cluster.
Furthermore, we proposed a brand-new architecture for the end-to-end tests (\ref{04:chapter:title}).
The improvements aim at \textit{scalability} and \textit{reduction of execution time}.
Through several experiments (\ref{06:chapter:title}), this paper shows that proposed mechanism with different configurations of the Kubernetes cluster (including \textit{number of Kubernetes nodes}, \textit{number of tests and suites executed in parallel}) significantly accelerated the execution of the tests.

% 3) related work
Related work focuses on improving the overall verification time of a Strimzi product.
For a long time and many releases of Strimzi, testing using a sequential computational model has been extremely slow.
Furthermore, the product contains about fifteen of the most critical possible combinations of product deployment, each of which lasts over sixty hours.
This sequential computational model is not a recommended candidate for verifying such numerous deployments.
An attentive reader could see the entire test time approaching one thousand hours, which is approximately one and a half month.

Nevertheless, as part of this effort for coarse-grained parallelism in performing multiple product deployments, it partially accelerated the overall computation.
However, this approach is not horizontally scalable due to our cloud services that provide resources (i.e., bare metals, virtual machines, containers).
Therefore, we got to the last opportunity to improve the computation using the vertical scalability of the resources (i.e., memory, central processing units) that the cloud services offer us.
This information motivated us to design and implement a mechanism of fine-grained parallelism in our test framework.
Figure \ref{00:fig:evolution} shows the overall evolution of our test framework and summarises the previously mentioned sentences.

\textbf{Acquisition of this work} \quad This work deals with the parallelisation of Kubernetes Strimzi system tests.
The author contributed the given code to the open-sourced project Strimzi available on Github\footnote{\textbf{Strimzi Github repository} \---\ \url{https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator}}, which also makes it possible to inspire other \emph{kube-native}\footnote{\textbf{Kube-native} \---\ it is a product that has been moved from the standalone world to the Kubernetes world. Moreover, it provides a communication interface (i.e., Kubernets REST API) with which it manages individual components (i.e., Apache Kafka is a standalone application, and Strimzi is a \emph{kube-native} product because it encapsulates Apache Kafka and provides a communication interface for the user.} products to implement such solutions.
The comprehensive benefit of this work is the significant acceleration of the verification process.

\textbf{The structure of the diploma thesis} \quad In Chapter \ref{02:chapter:title}, the reader will learn the theoretical background to understand the overall thesis (i.e., Kubernetes (\ref{01:sec:title}), Apache Kafka (\ref{02:sec:title}), Strimzi (\ref{03:title})).
In Chapter \ref{03:chapter:title}, we explain the fundamental concepts of parallelism (i.e., Amdahl's law (\ref{04:amdalhlaw}), Shared memory ()\ref{04:sharedmemory}), Process and Thread (\ref{04:processesandthreads}), Synchronisation (\ref{04:synchronization}).
Chapter \ref{04:chapter:title} presents bottlenecks in the current approach of testing the Strimzi product and proposes a brand-new computational architecture that solves many issues.
In Chapter \ref{05:chapter:title}, we describe the implementation of the proposed architecture.
Chapter \ref{06:chapter:title} presents many experiments with deep analysis on the thesis implementation.
Finally, in Chapters \ref{07:chapter:title},\ref{08:chapter:title}, we conclude the entire diploma with the knowledge that has been acquired, and at the same time, we discuss possible directions for possible future work.
